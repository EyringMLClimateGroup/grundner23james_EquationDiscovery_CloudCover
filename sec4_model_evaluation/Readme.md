The **sec41_physical_constraints** subfolder contains the script that was used to analyze whether the physical constraints are satisfied in the data set. For this, we split the data cube into smaller cubes and fit the data with a linear model. Its slope informed us of the validity of a given physical constraint (e.g., whether cloud cover always increases with cloud ice) in a small cube.
