The **sec511_feature_ranking** folder yields the SFS feature rankings reading the results from sec3_data-driven_modeling

The **sec512_balancing_performance_and_complexity** folder contains the Pareto plot (complexity x performance - plane with Pareto frontier). The script combine_results_dyamond.ipynb gathers all MSEs (from sec3_data-driven_modeling) to create this plot.

The **sec52_split_by_cloud_regimes** folder contains the evaluation of selected Pareto-optimal cloud cover schemes on different cloud regimes (on DYAMOND data).

The **sec53_transferability_to_era5** folder contains the transfer learning test of all Pareto-optimal cloud cover schemes to the ERA5 data set.
