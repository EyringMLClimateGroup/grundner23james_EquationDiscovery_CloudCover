Steps to coarse-grain the data:
1. Run convert_qi_and_qc_to_nc.nc and horizontal_coarse_graining.sh concurrently until all files are processed.
2. Run check_completeness.ipynb and potentially Step 1 again, if some files were deleted.
3. Run diagnose_clouds_from_qi_qc.ipynb, when convert_qi_and_qc_to_nc.nc has finished.
4. Rename variables if necessary (with mypartab) or in the filenames (with rename_files.ipynb)
5. Archive the data [The data is small enough (58GB), so it does not need to be archived.]
6. Coarse-grain clc data to cloud area fraction
-> Adapt and run generate_weights.py
-> Adapt and run cloud_area_fraction.py 
-> Horizontally coarse-grain cl_area
7. Coarse-grain clc data to cloud volume fraction
-> Horizontally
8. Coarse-grain data vertically (including cl_vol) [/home/b/b309170/workspace_icon-ml/vertical_interpolation/vert_interp_variability.py]
-> state_vars
-> cloud_vars

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Horizontal coarse-graining
==========================
horizontal_coarse_graining.sh:
------------------------------
Coarse-grains the data (specified variables) from $inpath and stores the output in $outpath.

check_completeness.ipynb:
-------------------------
If the file has the wrong number of time steps and has not been modified in the last hour, we directly remove it

Cloud Cover
===========
convert_qi_and_qc_to_nc.nc:
---------------------------
Copies qi and qc files to $outpath. Converts them to nc.

diagnose_clouds_from_qi_qc.ipynb:
---------------------------------
Manually creates clc file from qi and qc files in $outpath (diagnoses it from qi+qc). Removes original qi and qc files from $outpath.
