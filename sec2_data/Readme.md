The **sec21_DYAMOND** and **sec22_ERA5** subfolders contain horizontal coarse-graining scripts for both ERA5 and DYAMOND data. In **vertical_coarse-graining**, the general script for vertical coarse-graining and one specifically for cloud area fraction are stored. In **sec22_ERA5**, the scripts to reconstruct geometric height and air pressure from other variables are stored. In **sec21_DYAMOND**, we diagnose cloud cover from the cloud condensate mixing ratio and preprocess the data according to Section 2.1 of the paper (i.e., we remove spin-up, discard columns with NaNs, and remove redundant samples). The scripts *functions.py* and *my_classes.py* contain helper-functions.

In the notebook *analyze_data.ipynb* we compare DYAMOND to ERA5 data (yields Fig. 1).
