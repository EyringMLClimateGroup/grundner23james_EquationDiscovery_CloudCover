The subfolders **sec21_DYAMOND** and *sec22_ERA5* contain horizontal coarse-graining scripts for both ERA5 and DYAMOND data. In *vertical_coarse-graining* we store the general-purpose vertical coarse-graining script and one specifically for cloud area fraction. In *sec22_ERA5* the geometric height and the air pressure need to be reconstructed from other variables. In *sec21_DYAMOND* we diagnose cloud cover from the cloud condensate mixing ratio and preprocess the data according to Sec. 2.1 of the paper (i.e., remove the spin-up, discard columns with NaNs, remove redundant samples). The scripts *functions.py* and *my_classes.py* contain helper-functions.
