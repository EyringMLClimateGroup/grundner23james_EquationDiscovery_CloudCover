The **sec31_existing_schemes** folder contains the script for all pre-existing schemes, now fit to the DYAMOND data.
First of all, these are three different types of neural networks from Grundner et al., 2021. Second, it contains three different diagnostic cloud cover schemes from the literature. The Sundqvist scheme is currently used in the ICON model.

The **sec321_linear_models_and_polynomials** folder contains scripts and linear models and polynomials fit to the DYAMOND data with a sequential feature selection approach. 

The **sec322_neural_networks** folder contains scripts and neural networks fit to the DYAMOND data with a sequential feature selection approach.

The **sec33_symbolic_regression_fits** folder contains scripts and equations found using symbolic regression.
